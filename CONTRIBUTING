This module uses Dist::Zilla for it's build system.

In order to develop minor changes with this module you shouldn't 
need to install Dist::Zilla however.  You should be able to run
cpanm --installdeps . as usual.  Likewise prove -l t should also
work fine.

If you need to produce a release you will require Dist::Zilla.

$ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
$ dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm
$ dzil test
$ dzil smoke
$ dzil build 

Note that dependencies are added to dist.ini.  Then run dzil test
to trigger an update of the cpanfile.  The dist.ini is authoratitive,
we provide cpanfile so that cpanm continues to work out of the box.
